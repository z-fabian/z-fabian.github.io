## Coding and open source software
I support 100% reproducible scientific research and have released code for our work on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/z-fabian). The source code for our work on [MRAugment: a data augmentation pipeline for MRI](/publications/2021-07-01-data-augmentation-for-deep-learning) can be found [here](https://github.com/z-fabian/MRAugment) and our results on [Minimax lower bounds for transfer learning](/publications/2020-12-12-minimax-lower-bounds-for-transfer-learning) can be reproduced using the repo [here](https://github.com/z-fabian/TransferLowerbounds).

During my research projects with MRI data, I have heavily relied on [fastMRI dataset](https://fastmri.org/) from NYU and Facebook AI, and have contributed to the [fastMRI repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI).  

Prior to starting my graduate degree I had a chance to work as a Software Engineering Intern at [Bosch Hungary](https://www.bosch.hu/en/) developing automotive navigation software.
