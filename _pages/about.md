I am a postdoc at the [USC Center on AI Foundations for Science (AIF4S)](https://sites.usc.edu/aif4s/) advised by [Mahdi Soltanolkotabi](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~soltanol/).

I am interested in artificial intelligence and its applications to scientific problems. My research focuses on deep learning approaches for computer vision problems in medical and computational imaging. Recently, I have been interested in diffusion models for image reconstruction and multi-modal foundation models (especially reliability and understanding limitations).

My long-term research goal is to overcome the limitations of deep learning by designing more efficient, robust, and reliable algorithms, enabling deep learning to positively impact an even broader range of real-world applications.

You can find my publications [here](publications), along with the accompanying GitHub repositories, conference slides, posters and more.
