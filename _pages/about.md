I am a PhD candidate in electrical engineering at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I work as a research assistant at
the [Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) under the supervision of [Mahdi Soltanolkotabi](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~soltanol/) in the _Foundations of Learning from Signals and Data Lab_ and in close collaboration with the [vITAL Lab](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab) led by [Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/).

I am interested in artificial intelligence and its applications to scientific problems. My research focuses on deep learning approaches for computer vision problems in medical and computational imaging, and how to reduce reliance on large training datasets for such applications. During my PhD I have also worked on projects in transfer learning, self-supervised learning, continual learning, learning theory and optimization.

Deep learning models today are often data-hungry, fragile to small shifts in data distribution and computationally demanding. My long-term research goal is to lift the barriers of deep learning by designing more data-efficient, robust and light-weight algorithms, allowing deep learning to positively impact an even wider range of applications.
